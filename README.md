# Take Your Time

**Take Your Time** was developed as my capstone project during the web developement bootcamp at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) in winter 2020.

Take your Time helps the user to schedule and categorize their daily activities. They can sort their activities per categories to have an overview of the time spent on each of them so they can make the best out of their time.
